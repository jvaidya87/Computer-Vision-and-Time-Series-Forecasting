# Computer-Vision-and-Time-Series-Forecasting
Uses time-series data at a variety of time-steps to generate RGB images using Gramian Angular Fields; Then applies convolutional neural networks and hyperparameter optimization techniques to determine if time-series forecasting can be undertaken using the GAF images
